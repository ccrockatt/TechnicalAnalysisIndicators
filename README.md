# TechnicalAnalysisAutomation
Python functions for automating technical analysis. 

Important: 
The pyclustering library does not appear to work with the current version of numpy.

pip install numpy==1.23.1

This numpy version works for me. 
 
## Installation
Currently this is not published to pypi or similar so it can be installed via the following line in a requirements.txt 
or by specifying this package with pip install
`technical_analysis_indicator_suite @ git+https://github.com/ccrockatt/TechnicalAnalysisIndicators.git@457917bab7ec63c62704a2aa853374791bbca1a1`
